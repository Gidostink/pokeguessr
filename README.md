# pokeguessr
Pokéguessr is a small web app that challenges users to guess a Pokémon based on its Pokédex entries.

Currently, it's still far from finished, but progress is being made!

# Things to do:
- Allow questions to be answered. *(perhaps a little important)*
- Format the screen better for mobile users.
- Add a scoring system.
- Filter all Pokédex entries to remove self-referring entries, duplicates, and strange formatting.
- Create a 'daily challenge' system, where all users get the same seed each day.
