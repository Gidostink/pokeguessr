# pokeguessr
Pokéguessr is a small web app that challenges users to guess a Pokémon based on its Pokédex entries.

# Things to do:
- Improve UI design.
- Make answer submissions clearer.
- Add a scoring system.
- Filter all Pokédex entries to remove self-referring entries, duplicates, and strange formatting.
- Create a 'daily challenge' system, where all users get the same seed each day.
- Add a mode selector, with easier difficulties that reduce the amount of Pokémon to pick from.
