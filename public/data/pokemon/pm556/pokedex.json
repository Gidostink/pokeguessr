    "Once each year, this Pok\u00e9mon scatters its seeds. They\u2019re jam-packed with nutrients, making them a precious food source out in the desert.",
    "With noises that could be mistaken for the rattles of maracas, it creates an upbeat rhythm, startling bird Pok\u00e9mon and making them fly off in a hurry.",
    "Arid regions are their habitat. They move rhythmically, making a sound similar to maracas.",
    "It uses an up-tempo song and dance to drive away the bird Pok\u00e9mon that prey on its flower seeds.",
    "When it moves rhythmically, it makes a sound similar to maracas, making the surprised Pok\u00e9mon flee."
