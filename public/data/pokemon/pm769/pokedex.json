["Born from a sand mound playfully built by a child, this Pok\u00e9mon embodies the grudges of the departed.", "It takes control of anyone who puts a hand in its mouth. And so it adds to the accumulation of its sand-mound body.", "It likes the shovel on its head, so Sandygast will get serious and fight any children who come to take it back.", "If you build sand mounds when you\u2019re playing, destroy them before you go home, or they may get possessed and become Sandygast.", "Grudges of the dead have possessed a mound of sand and become a Pok\u00e9mon. Sandygast is fond of the shovel on its head.", "Sandygast mainly inhabits beaches. It takes control of anyone who puts their hand into its mouth, forcing them to make its body bigger.", "If it loses its shovel, it will stick something else\u2014like a branch\u2014in its head to make do until it finds another shovel.", "It flings sand into the eyes of its prey and tries to close in on them while they\u2019re blinded, but since Sandygast is so slow, the prey tends to escape."]
