["After being reborn as a ghost Pok\u00e9mon, Dreepy wanders the areas it used to inhabit back when it was alive in prehistoric seas.", "If this weak Pok\u00e9mon is by itself, a mere child could defeat it. But if Dreepy has friends to help it train, it can evolve and become much stronger.", "In the evening, groups of Dreepy will fly at high speeds over the ocean and poke at Pok\u00e9mon in the water for fun.", "It has a habit of biting at Clauncher even though it doesn\u2019t feed on them. This is said to be vestigial behavior from when Dreepy was alive."]
