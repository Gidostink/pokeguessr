    "There\u2019s a hole in its tail that allows it to draw in the air it needs to keep its fire burning. If the hole gets blocked, this Pok\u00e9mon will fall ill.",
    "It draws in air through its tail, transforms it into fire, and uses it like a tongue. It melts Durant and eats them.",
    "Using their very hot, flame-covered tongues, they burn through Durant\u2019s steel bodies and consume their insides.",
