    "Its cell composition is similar to water molecules. As a result, it can\u2019t be seen when it melts away into water.",
    "It lives close to water. Its long tail is ridged with a fin, which is often mistaken for a mermaid\u2019s.",
    "Tests show that its cells closely resemble water molecules, which perhaps explains its ability to conceal its form while submerged. I believe the origins of mermaid folklore lie with this Pok\u00e9mon.",
    "It has evolved to be suited for an aquatic life. It can become invisible when it melts away into water.",
    "Its body\u2019s cellular structure is similar to the molecular composition of water. It can melt invisibly in water.",
    "When _____\u2019s fins begin to vibrate, it is a sign that rain will come within a few hours.",
    "Its cell structure is similar to water molecules. It melts into the water and becomes invisible.",
    "It detects nearby moisture with its fin. When its fin begins trembling rapidly, that means rain will fall in a few hours.",
    "Clean, clear waters are its usual habitat. When it\u2019s about to be attacked by an invading enemy, it dives into the water to hide.",
    "Blending in with the water and erasing all signs of its presence, it patiently waits for its prey, fish Pok\u00e9mon.",
    "Its cells are composed of units much like water molecules. It lives close to water and is often mistaken for a mermaid.",
    "_____ underwent a spontaneous mutation and grew fins and gills that allow it to live underwater. This Pok\u00e9mon has the ability to freely control water.",
    "It has evolved to be suitable for an aquatic life. It can invisibly melt away into water.",
