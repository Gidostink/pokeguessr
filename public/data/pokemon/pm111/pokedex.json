	"Ludicrously strong\u2014when it butts heads with a mountain, it is the mountain that shatters. But its short legs struggle with turns, and it is incapable of stopping unless it collides with something.",
	"Its body is clad in a thick hide, and its tackles topple buildings. Unfortunately, it is not smart.",
	"It can remember only one thing at a time. Once it starts rushing, it forgets why it started.",
	"Strong, but not too bright, this Pok\u00e9mon can shatter even a skyscraper with its charging tackles.",
	"A Pok\u00e9mon with a one-track mind. Once it charges, it won\u2019t stop running until it falls asleep.",
	"_____\u2019s brain is very small. It is so dense, while on a run it forgets why it started running in the first place. It apparently remembers sometimes if it demolishes something.",

	"It doesn\u2019t care if there is anything in its way. It just charges and destroys all obstacles.",
	"Once it starts running, it doesn\u2019t stop. Its tiny brain makes it so stupid that it can\u2019t remember why it started running in the first place.",
	"Its massive bones are 1,000 times harder than human bones. Its Tackle can knock a semitrailer flying.",
	"Its massive bones are 1000 times harder than human bones. It can easily knock a trailer flying."
