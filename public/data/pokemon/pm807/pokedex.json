    "Electricity sparks from the pads on its limbs. Wherever _____ runs, lightning flashes and thunder echoes.",
    "It runs as fast as lightning strikes, shredding its opponents with its high-voltage claws.",
    "It approaches its enemies at the speed of lightning, then tears them limb from limb with its sharp claws.",
    "It electrifies its claws and tears its opponents apart with them. Even if they dodge its attack, they\u2019ll be electrocuted by the flying sparks."
