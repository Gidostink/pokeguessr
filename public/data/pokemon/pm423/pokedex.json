Should one Gastrodon encounter another of a different color, a fierce battle will inevitably ensue.", "It has strong regenerative capabilities. Even if parts of it are bitten off by fish Pok\u00e9mon, it will return to normal within a few hours.", "Plankton, invisible to the naked eye, is its main food source.
