    "I\u2019ve heard that the children of Hisui all begin to behave once they\u2019ve been told the story of how this Pok\u00e9mon roams about before the witching hour to spirit away misbehaving children.",
    "It doggedly pursues its prey wherever the prey goes. However, the chase is abandoned at sunrise.",
    "Making itself invisible, it silently sneaks up to prey. It has the ability to slip through thick walls.",
    "If it finds bad children who won\u2019t listen to their parents, it will spirit them away\u2014or so it\u2019s said.",
    "_____ wanders lost among the deep darkness of midnight. There is an oft-told admonishment given to misbehaving children that this Pok\u00e9mon will spirit away bad children who earn scoldings from their mothers.",
    "_____ can pass through any wall no matter how thick it may be. Once this Pok\u00e9mon chooses a target, it will doggedly pursue the intended victim until the break of dawn.",
    "If it finds bad children who won\u2019t listen to their parents, it will spirit them away--or so it\u2019s said.",
    "It doggedly pursues its prey wherever it goes. However, the chase is abandoned at sunrise.",
    "It loves the crying of children. It startles bad kids by passing through walls and making them cry.",
    "A glare from its single scarlet eye makes even burly grown-ups freeze in utter fear. It is a nocturnal Pok\u00e9mon that roams about under the cloak of darkness."
