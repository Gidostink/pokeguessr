Compressed underground, its body is as hard as steel.", "They were discovered a hundred years ago in an earthquake fissure. Inside each one is an energy core.", "Born deep within the ground, it compares itself with similar species, such as Geodude and Carbink, to settle which has the hardest body.", "The hexagonal cavity is its ear.
