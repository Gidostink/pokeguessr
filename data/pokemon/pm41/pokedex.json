    "Emits ultrasonic cries while it flies. They act as a sonar used to check for objects in its way.",

    "It has no eyeballs, so it can\u2019t see. It checks its surroundings via the ultrasonic waves it emits from its mouth.",
    "When exposed to sunlight, they suffer burns. The frequency of their ultrasonic waves can differ slightly from colony to colony.",
    "It sleeps in caves during the day. It has no eyes, so to check its surroundings while flying, it emits ultrasonic waves.",
    "_____ avoids sunlight because exposure causes it to become unhealthy. During the daytime, it stays in caves or under the eaves of old houses, sleeping while hanging upside down.",
    "_____ remains quietly unmoving in a dark spot during the bright daylight hours. It does so because prolonged exposure to the sun causes its body to become slightly burned.",
    "It has no eyes. Instead, it relies on its ultrasonic cries for echolocation to flit about in darkness.",
    "It does not need eyes, because it emits ultrasonic waves to check its surroundings while it flies.",
    "It checks its surroundings and location using reflections of the ultrasonic waves from its mouth.",
