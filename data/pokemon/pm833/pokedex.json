    "A popular game among children is to lift up sticks that _____ have bitten onto to see whose _____ can hang on the longest.",
    "Its large front tooth is still growing in. When the tooth itches, this Pok\u00e9mon will bite another _____\u2019s horn, and the two Pok\u00e9mon will tussle.",
    "It starts off battles by attacking with its rock-hard horn, but as soon as the opponent flinches, this Pok\u00e9mon bites down and never lets go.",
    "Apparently the itch of its teething impels it to snap its jaws at anything in front of it."
