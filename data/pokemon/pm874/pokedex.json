    "This Pok\u00e9mon spends its life gazing at the setting sun. It strides leisurely across grassy plains on legs of rock that weigh over 400 pounds each.",
    "The elemental composition of the rocks that form its body were found to match the bedrock of a land far away from this Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s habitat.",
    "Once a year, on a specific date and at a specific time, they gather out of nowhere and form up in a circle.",
    "It stands in grasslands, watching the sun\u2019s descent from zenith to horizon. This Pok\u00e9mon has a talent for delivering dynamic kicks."
