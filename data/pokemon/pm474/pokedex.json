Seems there might have been an error...", "In order to create a more advanced Pok\u00e9mon, an additional program was installed, but apparently it contained a defect that makes it move oddly.", "Its program was modified to facilitate extra-dimensional activities, but that led to noticeably strange behavior.", "Its behavior is noticeably unstable, which is apparently due to the incompetence of the engineer who updated its programming.", "A faulty update was added to its programming. Its behavior is noticeably strange, so the experiment may have been a failure.", "Porygon-Z had a program installed to allow it to move between dimensions, but the program also caused instability in Porygon-Z\u2019s behavior.", "Some say an additional program made this Pok\u00e9mon evolve, but even academics can\u2019t agree on whether Porygon-Z is really an evolution.", "Additional software was installed to make it an even better Pok\u00e9mon. It began acting oddly, however.", "A curious item induced this evolution. The Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s offensive capabilities have greatly increased, but the strangeness of its behavior has magnified in equal measure. This worries me."]
