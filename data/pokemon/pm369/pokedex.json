["RELICANTH is a POK\u00e9MON species that existed for a hundred million years without ever changing its form. This ancient POK\u00e9MON feeds on microscopic organisms with its toothless mouth.", "RELICANTH is a rare species that was discovered in deep-sea explorations. This POK\u00e9MON\u2019s body withstands the enormous water pressure of the ocean depths. Its body is covered in tough scales that are like craggy rocks.", "It has remained unchanged for 100 million years. It was discovered during a deep-sea exploration.", "A POK\u00e9MON that was once believed to have been extinct. The species has not changed its form for 100 million years. It walks on the seafloor using its pectoral fins.", "A rare Pok\u00e9mon discovered during a deep-sea exploration. It has not changed in over 100 million years.", "Discovered by chance during deep-sea explorations, it has not changed since ancient times.", "A rare Pok\u00e9mon discovered during a deep-sea exploration. It has not changed in over 100 million years.", "It has remained unchanged for 100 million years.

This Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s body withstands the enormous water pressure of the ocean depths. Its body is covered in tough scales that are like craggy rocks.", "Its form has remained the same for one hundred million years. Its body is filled with fat, so it can withstand the water pressure of the deep sea.", "It was fortuitously discovered during a deep sea expedition. Its teeth have atrophied, so it now survives on microscopic organisms it sucks up.", "Thought to have gone extinct, Relicanth was given a name that is a variation of the name of the person who discovered it.", "The reason it hasn\u2019t changed at all in a hundred million years is that it\u2019s apparently already a perfect life-form.", "Rock-hard scales and oil-filled swim bladders allow this Pok\u00e9mon to survive the intense water pressure of the deep sea.", "This Pok\u00e9mon was discovered during deep-sea exploration. Its appearance hasn\u2019t changed in 100,000,000 years, so it\u2019s called a living fossil.", "This rare Pok\u00e9mon was discovered during a deep-sea exploration. It has not changed in over 100 million years."]
