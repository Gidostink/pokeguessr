    "Trying to pet _____ before it trusts you will result in a nasty scratch from its sharp claws. Be careful.",
    "It spends even the smallest amount of downtime grooming its fur with its tongue. Loose fur gathers in its stomach and serves as fuel for fiery moves.",
    "Its coat regrows twice a year. When the time comes, _____ sets its own body on fire and burns away the old fur.",
    "If you try too hard to get close to it, it won\u2019t open up to you. Even if you do grow close, giving it too much affection is still a no-no.",
    "It doesn\u2019t allow its emotions to be easily seen. Earning its trust takes time. It prefers solitude.",
    "While grooming itself, it builds up fur inside its stomach. It sets the fur alight and spews fiery attacks, which change based on how it coughs."
