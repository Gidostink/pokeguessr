["Despite its adorable appearance, when it gets angry and flails about, its arms and legs could knock a pro wrestler sprawling.", "A touch from anyone except a known friend sends it into a surging frenzy. It\u2019s an incredibly dangerous Pok\u00e9mon.", "It boasts power enough to split large trees in half. The organ on its rear releases an odor that it uses to communicate with others of its kind.", "Stufful hates to be hugged or touched in any way. It will squirm, thrash, and resist with amazing power.", "Its fluffy fur is a delight to pet, but carelessly reaching out to touch this Pok\u00e9mon could result in painful retaliation.", "The way it protects itself by flailing its arms may be an adorable sight, but stay well away. This is flailing that can snap thick tree trunks."]
