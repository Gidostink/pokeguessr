    "Though its punches are powerful, this Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s movements are sluggish. It blows icy bubbles from its mouth to immobilize its opponents.",
    "The detached pincers of these Pok\u00e9mon are delicious. Some Trainers bring Lechonk into the mountains just to search for them.",
    "Before it stops to think, it just starts pummeling. There are records of its turning back avalanches with a flurry of punches.",
    "It stores coldness in its pincers and pummels its foes. It can even smash thick walls of ice to bits!",
    "It just throws punches indiscriminately. In times of desperation, it can lop off its own pincers and fire them like rockets.",
    "It aimed for the top but got lost and ended up on a snowy mountain. Being forced to endure the cold, this Pok\u00e9mon evolved and grew fur."
