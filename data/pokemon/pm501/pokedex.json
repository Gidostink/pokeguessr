    "This Pok\u00e9mon from the Unova region uses the shell on its belly as a weapon to cut down its foes. Thus, I\u2019ve conferred upon this shell the name \u201cscalchop.\u201d",
    "The scalchop on its stomach isn\u2019t just used for battle\u2014it can be used to break open hard berries as well.",
    "It fights using the scalchop on its stomach. In response to an attack, it retaliates immediately by slashing.",
    "The scalchop on its stomach isn\u2019t just used for battle--it can be used to break open hard berries as well.",
    "The scalchop on its stomach is made from the same elements as claws. It detaches the scalchop for use as a blade."
