["The weakest Dragon-type Pok\u00e9mon, it lives in damp, shady places, so its body doesn\u2019t dry out.", "It\u2019s covered in a slimy membrane that makes any punches or kicks slide off it harmlessly.", "The weakest of all Dragon-type Pok\u00e9mon, it\u2019s unable to breathe if its skin dries out, so it sticks to shady places.", "Its source of protection is its slimy, germ-laden mucous membrane. Anyone who touches it needs some thorough hand-washing.", "It uses its horns to check out its surroundings. They\u2019re very sensitive, so if you grab them, it will feel a strong shock and be unable to move.", "Its body is mostly water. If it dries out, it will die, so it\u2019s always sitting with perfect stillness in the shade.", "Because most of its body is water, it will dry up if the weather becomes too arid. It\u2019s considered the weakest dragon Pok\u00e9mon.", "Their horns are powerful sensors. As soon as Goomy pick up any sign of enemies, they go into hiding. This is how they\u2019ve survived.", "Goomy hides away in the shade of trees, where it\u2019s nice and humid. If the slime coating its body dries out, the Pok\u00e9mon instantly becomes lethargic.", "Most of a Goomy\u2019s body is water. A membrane covers the whole Pok\u00e9mon to prevent it from shriveling up in dry weather.", "Goomy\u2019s horns are excellent sensory organs that cover all five of Goomy\u2019s senses. Goomy picks up on danger from the movement of the air."]
